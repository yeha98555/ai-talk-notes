Thanks for your interest in improving **AI Engineering Talks — Classified &
Distilled**! New talks, corrections, and translations are all welcome. This
guide covers how the site is built and how to add or translate content.

## How it works

The two published pages — `index.html` (English) and `index.zh.html` (Traditional
Chinese) — are **generated** from small sources under [`src/`](src/) by
[`build.mjs`](build.mjs). CSS and JS are inlined, so each page is a single,
dependency-free file you can open straight from disk.

**All talk content is authored in Markdown**, for every language. The build
renders that Markdown into language-agnostic HTML:

- **Notes** — `src/notes/shell.html` (the lightbox shell) + `src/notes/doc-*.md`
  (English) + `src/i18n/<locale>/notes/doc-*.md` (translations).
- **Category cards** — `src/sections/cat-*.md` (English: `color` + `docs` structure
  and card text) + `src/i18n/<locale>/sections/cat-*.md` (translated card text).
- **Chrome / overview / themes** — small HTML files (`src/partials/*.html`,
  `src/sections/overview.html`, `src/sections/themes.html`) because they carry
  SVGs, metric blocks, and inline citation links that don't reduce to plain text;
  translations are full HTML mirrors under `src/i18n/<locale>/`.

Anything without a translation **falls back to English**, so partial translations
are always safe to commit.

## Build & check

```bash
npm run build              # or: node build.mjs — emits index.html + index.zh.html
node tools/i18n-check.mjs  # verify the two pages stay structurally identical
```

`i18n-check.mjs` compares the two built pages for identical `id`/`href`/SVG
structure and shell counts, reports translation coverage, and flags any
untranslated text or a literal `undefined` from a missing frontmatter field. It
should exit `0` with no `FAIL` lines. Requires Node.js; no packages to install.

## Markdown formats

### A talk note — `doc-<N>.md`

```markdown
---
title: The talk's title
speaker: Speaker Name, Company
video: https://youtu.be/XXXXXXXX
---
The first paragraph of the notes.

A second paragraph. Use a blank line between paragraphs.

1. An ordered list item
2. Another — numbers continue across interruptions if you keep numbering
   (e.g. write `3.` for a list that resumes after a paragraph)

- A bullet
- Another bullet

Use **bold** where needed. End a line with a backslash \
to force a hard line break inside a paragraph.
```

- `title`, `speaker`, and `video` are all required (a missing field renders the
  literal text `undefined`, which the checker flags).
- `video` is language-agnostic: only the **English** `doc-<N>.md` needs it;
  translations inherit it.

### A category section — `cat-<K>.md`

```markdown
---
heading: Category name (no letter prefix)
desc: One-sentence description of the category.
color: #2563eb
docs: 12, 34
---
## Card 1 talk title
@ Speaker, Company
One-paragraph summary of the talk.

## Card 2 talk title
@ Speaker
Another summary.
```

The `##` blocks map onto the section's cards **in order**, and `docs` lists the
talk id for each card in the same order — so `docs` and the `##` blocks must have
the same count and stay positionally aligned (`docs[i]` ↔ card `i`). Cards within a
section are kept in **alphabetical order by title**. `color` is the category's accent color. Everything else (card id,
the `#NN` idnum, `#doc-N` links, the source-video URL, the talk count) is derived —
the video comes from each card's `notes/doc-N.md`.

## Adding a talk

1. **Note** — create `src/notes/doc-<N>.md` (format above) with `<N>` the next
   free number.
2. **Order** — append `"doc-<N>"` to `src/notes/order.json`.
3. **Card** — in the right `src/sections/cat-<K>.md`, add `<N>` to the `docs:` list
   and a matching `## title / @ speaker / summary` block. Cards are ordered
   **alphabetically by title**, so insert the block at its alphabetical position and
   put `<N>` at the matching index in `docs:` — the two stay positionally aligned, so
   don't just append. (The card's id, idnum, `#doc-N` links, and source-video URL are
   all derived — the video is read from the note you just created.)
4. **Count** — bump the displayed total talk count. It is hard-coded in several
   hand-authored spots: `src/partials/hero.html` (lead paragraph + the *Talk notes*
   metric), `src/sections/overview.html`, `src/sections/themes.html`,
   `src/partials/footer.html`, **each of their `src/i18n/<locale>/` mirrors** (the
   localized chrome always renders, so bump it even for an English-only add), and both
   READMEs (`README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`). Find every occurrence with
   `grep -rn '<old-count>' src README.md README.zh-TW.md` (ignore `#tNN`, `doc-<id>`,
   and `NN%` matches). This total is not derived, and `i18n-check.mjs` does not verify
   it.
5. **(Optional) Key Themes** — the "Key Themes" section (`src/sections/themes.html`)
   is a *curated* set of 9 cross-cutting insights, each citing a handful of
   representative talks — not every talk appears. If the new talk supports one (or
   more) of those insights, add a ref chip to that theme's `.refs` block:
   `<a class="refchip" href="#t<N>" title="<full English title>">#<N> <title,
   truncated>…</a>`. The `#t<N>` anchor is the talk's card id (auto-derived from
   `<N>`). Mirror the same chip in each `src/i18n/<locale>/sections/themes.html` (keep
   the English `title=` attribute; translate only the visible chip text) so the two
   pages keep identical `href`s — `i18n-check.mjs` enforces that parity.
6. **(Optional) translate** — add `src/i18n/zh/notes/doc-<N>.md` and a matching
   card block in `src/i18n/zh/sections/cat-<K>.md`.
7. **Build & check** — `npm run build && node tools/i18n-check.mjs`.

## Translating

Translations are text-only. To translate an existing talk into an existing
locale (e.g. `zh`):

1. Add `src/i18n/zh/notes/doc-<N>.md` — same format as the English note, but you
   only need `title` + `speaker` in the frontmatter (the `video` is inherited).
   Translate the body prose to **Traditional Chinese, Taiwan-style (zh-Hant)**.
2. Translate the card in `src/i18n/zh/sections/cat-<K>.md` (same `##` block
   position/order as the English card).
3. Keep speaker/company/product names and established jargon (RAG, LLM, MCP,
   Claude Code, …) as-is where natural; never change `id`/`href`/structure in the
   HTML-mirror files.
4. `npm run build && node tools/i18n-check.mjs`, then open `index.zh.html` to
   spot-check.

### Adding a new language

The Markdown/text pipeline is locale-generic, but a brand-new language also needs
a few wiring changes:

1. Create `src/i18n/<locale>/` mirroring `zh/`: `meta.json` (page `<title>`),
   `notes/doc-*.md`, `sections/cat-*.md`, and HTML mirrors of `partials/*.html`,
   `sections/overview.html`, and `sections/themes.html`.
2. In `build.mjs`, add the locale to `LOCALES` and a `LABELS[<locale>]` entry
   (source-video / close / full-notes / talks / footer-note strings), and extend
   the head detection/redirect script and the `EN | 中文` toggle for the new page.
3. Add a `T[<locale>]` string table in `src/scripts/reading-progress.js` and
   `src/scripts/notes.js` so their injected UI is localized.

## Discovery pipeline data (v2)

Two git-tracked JSON files at the repo root feed the v2 "discover → track → pick →
generate" pipeline that runs *before* the manual note authoring above (see
[`PRD-v2.md`](PRD-v2.md)). They are the single source of truth for that pipeline;
every stage only reads/writes these two files plus `src/`.

### `channels.json` — the tracked-channel list

```json
[
  { "id": "UCg3pI4p6OKSFrDVZcwRIx8A", "name": "AI Native Dev", "handle": "@tessl-ai" }
]
```

- `id` — the YouTube `channel_id`, used to build the RSS feed URL
  (`https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<id>`, no API key needed).
- `name` / `handle` — for human recognition only; not used to fetch.

To find a channel's `id`, open any of its videos and read `"channelId":"UC…"` from
the watch-page HTML, or the `externalChannelId` field.

### `queue.json` — the video queue

Starts as `[]`. `poll.mjs` appends newly-discovered videos as `pending`; you approve
or reject them; `gen-note.mjs` later marks them `published`.

```json
[
  {
    "videoId": "tTcxVv8HHNw",
    "title": "Learning while you sleep: Beyond memory to dreaming",
    "channel": "AI Native Dev",
    "published": "2026-06-20T00:00:00Z",
    "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tTcxVv8HHNw/hqdefault.jpg",
    "url": "https://youtu.be/tTcxVv8HHNw",
    "status": "pending",
    "docId": null,
    "note": null
  }
]
```

- `status` — lifecycle: `pending` → `approved` / `rejected` → `published`.
- `docId` — filled in once a note is generated (e.g. `doc-100`), so a video is never
  processed twice.
- `note` — optional free-text memo written while picking (e.g. "off-topic, maybe").

## Conventions

- `index.html` / `index.zh.html` are **build artifacts and are git-ignored** — do
  **not** commit them. Vercel rebuilds them from source on deploy. Locally, run
  `npm run build` to (re)generate them before opening a page or running the checker.
- Keep commits focused; run `npm run build && node tools/i18n-check.mjs` before pushing.
- `modal.js` and `nav-scrollspy.js` inject no user-facing text and should not
  need edits; `reading-progress.js` / `notes.js` keep all UI strings in a
  `T[lang]` table.
